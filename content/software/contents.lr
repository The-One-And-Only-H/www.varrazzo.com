A selection of free software projects I maintain or contribute to.

Some of these projects are actively maintained: some might use some extra
effort.

If you would like to encourage their development, or would like to steer
development towards features you are interested into, `your contribution is
welcome <https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo/>`__.

`psycopg2`_ is the de-facto standard for interoperation between Python and
PostgreSQL.

I have been involved in development and testing since inception (when psycopg 1
was a thing), and since about 2010 have been maintaining the project: first
writing documentation, completing a test grid, setting up the web presence
(website, mailing list), and finally finding myself responsible for the
codebase.

Please refer to the `psycopg homepage`__ for any information about the project.

body:

psycopg3 is not here yet, but I have been thinking about a psycopg2 successor
for a long time.

I would like to design the interface based on years of understanding where
psycopg2 users have found the most problems, using more up-to-date
communication protocols to the database server, maybe taking the change to
review the whole DB-API standard and bring it to modern time.

More to follow, in a couple of articles.
