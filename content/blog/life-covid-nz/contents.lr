When it seems now a million of years ago, Gabri and I organised a 2 weeks
journey in New Zealand, because an Antipodean March sounded better than one
in London, and I still had an agreement of 25% time off work with my employer.

Many things changed since. My employer and I, let's say, agreed to move to a
100% time off arrangement in February. A few days later, news of the Covid-19
started resembling bad science fiction ones. My family and friends in Italy
were in lockdown, the UK government was going in all the directions at once.
We had the option to not leave, or the one to leave for longer, and we picked
the latter, calling the flight company on the same day of leaving to postpone
our return.

In the first weeks it's been a pleasant journey. The country is beautiful. I
hardly have words for it so I try to create images.

Our home and transportation consisted in van equipped with a bed, a small
fridge and hobs. A porta-potty makes it self-contained, meaning we could sleep
overnight in many natural reserves. Pretty much everywhere we slept there was
public toilets, always clean, even when they were only latrines. No shower
onboard, so every few days we stopped into a camping to have one.

Our daily routine consisted in a morning coffee and breakfast, then exploring
the area we were. I was able to do much of the photography I love, the one
consisting in hiking boots and tripod. If we had food in some town we looked
for a place to recharge the laptop.

After dinner, it was hacking time: I have started :ref:`writing psycopg3
<blog/thinking-psycopg3>` and I have had regular hacking sessions, using the
dimmest display setting to save as battery as possible, with only offline
documentation, no network: all in all a lot of focus. The project is taking
its shape, but I'd rather avoid tech speak for this entry: you can read more
at :ref:`blog/psycopg3-first-report`.

A bit more than a week we were into New Zealand, the country imposed
self-isolation to all the people coming from abroad, so our arrival was well
timed to be able to keep on travelling. Into our third week the country went
to level 3, with the plan to go to level 4 in 48 hours.
