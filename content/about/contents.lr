body:

I am an Italian software developer, with mathematical background, currently
based in London.

Software development has long been my passion, before becoming py profession.
Outside of my paid-for job, I have been involved in several `Free Software
projects </software>`__.

I would love to pay more attention to some of these projects: if you would like
to encourage their development, or to steer it towards features you are
interested into, please `consider a sponsorship

Outside of software development I appreciate art, especially visual art, and I
practice `photography </photo>`__ as the right intersection between the
artistic and the scientific mind.
